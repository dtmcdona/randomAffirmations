1. To install buildozer you need to visit https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
2. You then change directory with a terminal to the parent directory and use "buildozer init" in the terminal
3. App has all of its main settings in buildozer.spec file
4. Once you have edited anything in the buildozer.spec file you then build in terminal with "buildozer -v android debug"
